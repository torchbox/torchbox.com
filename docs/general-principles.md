# General principles for the build

## Make it an excellent example of our skills

The torchbox.com site aims to be a gold-standard for accessibility, sustainability, performance, SEO best practice and design.

## Fewer templates and reusable components

On the previous torchbox.com build we found that some page types were too inflexible for editor needs. A key aim for this iteration is to work with fewer page templates, and a more reusable set of streamfield blocks that can be used across page types.

## Key questions to ask when starting on a new piece of work:

- Do we need a new page type or could an existing page type be used for this content
- Is the design mandating the content to sit in a particular order and could this be more flexible?
- If there are new streamfield blocks, will they be used across the whole site and will they work on other page templates?

## Clear editor guidelines

We have created a set of editor guidelines. This should be updated with information on accessibility, image processing, image formats and content authoring. We have QA reminders in the merge request template and the ticket template to update this document when new work is done. A private link, for Torchbox employees only, can be found at https://intranet.torchbox.com/torchbox-com-project-docs.

## Good documentation of both front-end and back-end

We have reminders in the MR and QA on tickets to update the docs, which will cover both front-end and back-end code.

## Good QA throughout to ensure weâ€™re meeting best practice

Our MR template and QA list on tickets remind us to test for accessibility and sustainability as part of our development process.
