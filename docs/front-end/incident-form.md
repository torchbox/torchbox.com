# Incident form

We display the incident form in an iframe on a standard page. It is hosted separately so that it will still be available if the Torchbox website is down.

The incident form contains many of the torchbox.com styles, and lots of variables and mixins are copied over. If you make changes on the torchbox site, especially to form styles, you may need to visit the [incident form repo](https://git.torchbox.com/internal/incident-form/) to update the styles there.
