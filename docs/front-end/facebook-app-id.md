# Facebook app id

The facebook app is controlled by the Torchbox organisation. In order to update the app, you need someone who has full access to the Torchbox organisation to give you permission to manage the apps. Permission is granted to your own faceobook account, and you need to ensure you have a [developer account](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/register/).

Once you have access granted you can find and edit the app called 'Torchbox.com post feed'.
