# Sustainability

In order to make the site more sustainable we ensure that images are served in a suitable size for the screen they are displayed on, whether they are background images or images loaded with an <img> tag. We can use <picture> elements with srcset and sizes. See https://docs.wagtail.org/en/v5.2.2/advanced_topics/images/image_file_formats.html#using-the-picture-element.

We use lazy loading for all images below the fold.

We use dark mode by default.

All images should be renedered in the template file as webp format.
