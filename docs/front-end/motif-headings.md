# Motif headings

The site makes use of coloured drop-cap letters in major headings, with an optional animation on heading ones.

Because some letters are narrower than others, there was an issue with a large gap after the initial drop-cap, as well as an issue with the letter I where it was too narrow to see the final background flame image. This has been solved with some custom classes for particular letters.

See the `motif-heading.html` component (under `atoms` in the styleguide) and the equivalent `motif-heading.scss` sass file.
