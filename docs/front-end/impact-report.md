# Impact report template

This has been designed to make use of existing blocks with a couple of special ones needed for the impact report.

## Impact report heading

Creates the heading blocks used down the page, and the anchor links in the in-page navigation. The image is required, and is expected to be a graphic rather than a photograph.

## Instagram blcok

Currently this is just adapted from the old site, but there are some accessibility concerns with the images being links, as this isn't immediately clear from visually scanning the page. This could potentially be considered for a redesign further down the line.

## Small image with text block

Ideally this would be reworked to allow a selection from a limited set of icons, which would then update with the theme - a bit like how the 'Homepage showcase' block works. For speed we have kept this as an image upload, like the old site, so that the icons will not adapt to the page changing theme. This is not a big concern as the page is unlikely to change theme once it is published.

## Sticky navigation

Unlike the old site this is a simple CSS implementation of a sticky navigation. If there are other features desired, like a different style on becoming sticky, or a back-to-top link, we can consider this post-launch.
