# Using Picsum for placeholder images

Use picsum for any images that you need to mock out in the pattern library.

The benefits of picsum:

- Allows webp
- Does not rely on reading cross-site cookies like Unsplash
- Faster than Unsplash

You can choose a specific image by browsing their library at https://picsum.photos/images
Or use a random image: https://picsum.photos/540/190.webp

Generate a selection of images in different formats, all using the same seed image:

https://picsum.photos/seed/picsum/200/300.webp
https://picsum.photos/seed/picsum/1000/1000.webp
https://picsum.photos/seed/picsum/2900/300.webp
