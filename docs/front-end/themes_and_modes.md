#Themes and modes

## Modes

The site has been initially built in dark-mode only, but the longer-term plan is to introduce a toggle switch where the user can opt to display it in light mode. The CSS to set the mode is an html class of either `.mode-dark` or `.mode-light`.

## Themes

An editor has an option to select a theme on each page. Selecting a theme on a page will change it for that page, and all child pages, unless another selection is made further down the page tree.

There are currently 3 themes in use: coral, lagoon and banana. The CSS to set the theme is an html class of either `.theme-coral`, `.theme-lagoon` or `.theme-banana`.

???+ note

    If you are adding a new theme, check the colour contrast for all the new accent colours added, used in the drop-caps (remember to check both dark mode and light mode). They need to pass colour contrast as if the entire drop-cap was filled with that colour.

    The drop-caps svgs use a semi-transparent version of the accent colours, and the contrast of the resulting colour also needs to be checked. The [colour contrast checker](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/colour-contrast-checker/nmmjeclfkgjdomacpcflgdkgpphpmnfe?hl=en-GB&utm_source=ext_sidebar) is a useful chrome extension to assist with this.

## CSS Variables

All colours should be set using CSS variables, and these are updated according to the theme or mode in use on any given page.

## Defaults

The site will show in dark mode by default, and if a theme is not selected for a page or any parent pages, then it will display with the coral theme.
