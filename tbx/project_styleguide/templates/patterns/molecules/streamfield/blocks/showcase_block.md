# Showcase Block

- Used to show a list of items in a grid format, with 2 columns on desktop and 1 column on mobile.
- Each item shows a title and text and can have an optional link.
- The example here shows items with an without links for demonstration purposes but in reality you would either have all items with links or all items without links.
- The icons used to the left of the item should update with theme choice.
- The title of the block is optional. If included, we use h3s for each item heading. If excluded, then the item headings become h2s.
- There is a slightly different version of the showcase block that is used on the home page. It is a different block but shares the template and styling due to similar design.
